== Simulation Errors Handling

It might be possible that unexpected errors occur during simulations.
But how would you know that this is the case, you might ask yourself?
It could as well be, that someone just **wanted** this simulation to respond with an HTTP 500 code.

That's why we've invented the custom HTTP 555 status code: Simulation failed with an Exception!

The error can be asserted from the client side, the body containing more detailed information.
