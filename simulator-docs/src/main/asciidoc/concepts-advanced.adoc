== Execution Modes in Citrus Simulator

The Citrus Simulator offers different modes of operation to accommodate various testing scenarios and requirements.
These modes dictate how the simulator executes the test scenarios.
It comes with two modes, a synchronous and an asynchronous one, providing flexibility in how interactions are simulated and tested.

[[concept-advanced-execution-sync-mode]]
=== Synchronous Execution Mode

The synchronous execution mode ensures that scenarios are executed one after the other, in a single thread.
This mode is beneficial for scenarios where operations need to be performed in a strict sequence, and data consistency is crucial.

==== Configuration

To configure the simulator in synchronous mode, set the `citrus.simulator.mode` property in your application's configuration file (`application.properties` or `application.yml`) to `sync`.
If this property is not set at all, the simulator defaults to synchronous mode.

.Example `application.properties`
----
citrus.simulator.mode=sync
----

.Example `application.yml`
----
citrus:
  simulator:
    mode: sync
----

[[concept-advanced-execution-async-mode]]
=== Asynchronous Execution Mode

In asynchronous execution mode, scenarios are executed concurrently in separate threads, allowing for parallel processing.
This mode is suitable for more complex simulations where scenarios do not depend on the execution order or when simulating high concurrency.

==== Configuration

To enable asynchronous mode, set the `citrus.simulator.mode` property to `async`.
Additionally, you can configure the number of executor threads that handle the parallel execution of scenarios through the `citrus.simulator.executor.threads` property.

.Example `application.properties`
----
citrus.simulator.mode=async
citrus.simulator.executor.threads=10
----

.Example `application.yml`
----
citrus:
  simulator:
    mode: async
    executor:
      threads: 10
----

[[concept-advanced-execution-custom-mode]]
=== Custom Executors

For advanced scenarios, you have the flexibility to provide custom executors by implementing the `ScenarioExecutorService` interface.
This allows for tailored execution strategies, such as custom thread management, prioritization of scenarios, or integration with external systems for scenario execution.

To use a custom executor, define your implementation of the `ScenarioExecutorService` and register it as a bean in your Spring application context.
Ensure that your custom executor is appropriately configured to be recognized by the simulator in place of the default synchronous or asynchronous executors.
To disable the default synchronous executor, set the following property: `citrus.simulator.mode=custom`.

.Example Custom Executor Bean Definition
[source,java]
----
@Bean
public ScenarioExecutorService customScenarioExecutorService() {
    return new MyCustomScenarioExecutorService();
}
----

This custom executor will then be used by the simulator to execute scenarios according to the logic you've implemented.

== Best Practices

- Use the _synchronous mode_ as the standard, for linear simulations where data consistency matters or when debugging to ensure straightforward tracing of actions and outcomes.
- Opt for the _asynchronous mode_ only when explicitly needed, when simulating more complex scenarios that involve intermediate synchronous messages.

By understanding and appropriately configuring the execution modes of the Citrus Simulator, you can tailor the simulation environment to best suit your testing needs, whether you require precise control over scenario execution or need to simulate high-volume, concurrent interactions.

[[concept-advanced-database-schema]]
== Database Schema

In some cases, it may be useful to keep the database schema in mind.
The following diagram illustrates the database schema as defined in the package `org.citrusframework.simulator.model`, which should be considered the source of truth.
This visual representation can help understand the relationships and structure of the database entities.

[[concept-advanced-runtime-scenario-registration]]
== Registering Simulator Scenarios at Runtime

Registering simulator scenarios at runtime is a perfectly valid approach.
However, it's crucial to ensure that the scenario cache used by the simulator remains synchronized.

A "Scenario" in this context is not a database entity but rather a conceptual object that exists only during runtime.
Essentially, these are simply Spring beans.
The `ScenarioLookupService` is responsible for tracking these scenarios but cannot do so automatically.
Therefore, after making modifications, it's necessary to call `ScenarioLookupService#evictAndReloadScenarioCache()` to update the cache.

The following Java source code illustrates how to register a custom scenario and update the scenario cache:

[source,java]
----
import org.citrusframework.simulator.service.ScenarioLookupService;
import org.springframework.beans.factory.config.ConfigurableListableBeanFactory;
import org.springframework.context.ApplicationContext;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;

@Configuration
public class MyCustomBeanConfiguration {

    public MyCustomBeanConfiguration(ApplicationContext applicationContext, ScenarioLookupService scenarioLookupService) {
        // Replace 'MyCustomSimulatorScenario' with your custom scenario class
        SimulatorScenario simulatorScenario = new MyCustomSimulatorScenario();

        ConfigurableListableBeanFactory beanFactory = ((ConfigurableApplicationContext) applicationContext).getBeanFactory();
        beanFactory.registerSingleton(simulatorScenario.getClass().getSimpleName(), simulatorScenario);

        scenarioLookupService.evictAndReloadScenarioCache();
    }
}
----
