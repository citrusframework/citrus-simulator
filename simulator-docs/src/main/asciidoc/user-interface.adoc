[[user-interface]]
= User Interface

The simulator application, initiated as a Spring Boot web application, offers an intuitive user interface to enhance user interaction and efficiency.
Upon launching the simulator and navigating to http://localhost:8080 in your browser, you are greeted with the default welcome page, designed for straightforward interaction and focused on displaying JSON response data from the simulator REST API.

image:default-ui.png[The default Simulator UI, title="Default UI of the Citrus Simulator"]

For an enriched experience, the simulator supports a more advanced user interface built with Angular, providing comprehensive administrative capabilities.
This enhanced UI allows users to effortlessly monitor the simulator's status and review detailed logs of executed scenarios and their outcomes.

[[user-interface-integration]]
== Integrating the Angular-based UI

To integrate the advanced Angular-based UI into your simulator project, add the following Maven dependency:

.Citrus Simulator UI Dependency
[source,xml]
-----
<!-- Simulator web ui -->
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.citrusframework</groupId>
  <artifactId>citrus-simulator-ui</artifactId>
  <version>${citrus.simulator.version}</version>
</dependency>
-----

Replace `${citrus.simulator.version}` with the appropriate version of the Citrus Simulator you are using.
This information can typically be found in the project documentation or the repository where the simulator is hosted.

Upon successful integration and starting the simulator, the Angular-based UI becomes accessible at http://localhost:8080, automatically enhancing the default user interface without any additional configuration.
The simulator dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of your project, presenting key metrics and insights at a glance.

Using the "Reset"-button, it's also possible to delete all recorded Test Results and Executions.

[[user-interface-scenarios]]
== Scenarios

The "Scenarios" tab within the user interface displays all scenarios available for automatic mapping upon handling incoming requests.
This tab not only lists the scenarios but also offers functionalities such as initiating scenario executions directly from the UI.

image:scenario-list.png[Scenario Executions, title="List of available scenarios in the simulator"]

Selecting any scenario from the list opens a detailed view of that specific scenario.
This view includes comprehensive information about the scenario, such as the messages processed during executions and the results of each execution, providing valuable insights into the behavior and outcome of the scenario.

image:scenario-details.png[Scenario Details, title="Detailed view of a scenario, including execution details"]

Each scenario detail page is designed to offer a deep dive into the scenario's workings, including the input and output data, any validations or assertions applied, and a step-by-step breakdown of the scenario's execution path.
This level of detail aids in understanding each scenario's role within the simulator and troubleshooting any issues that may arise.

[[user-interface-scenario-results]]
== Scenario Executions

Every execution of a scenario within the simulator is meticulously recorded, with the results readily accessible through the user interface for review and analysis.

image:scenario-executions.png[Scenario Executions, title="Overview of scenario executions, showing a list with statuses and key details"]

This view also provides rich filter possibilities, by name, status and so on. Even by headers of recorded messages.

.Message Header Filtering

Message header filtering uses a specific syntax.

* If you don't specify a key or comparator, the filter will search for messages where *any* header value *contains* the provided string. (e.g., `myValue`)
* To filter based on a *specific key*, use `key=value`. (e.g., `source=myApp`)
* You can also use the *CONTAINS* operator (`~`) to search within a key's value. (e.g., `name~something-like-this`)
* For numeric keys, you can use comparison operators like `<, `<=`, `>`, `>=`. (e.g., `priority<3`)

Combining multiple patterns: Separate multiple filter expressions with a semicolon (`;`). They will be combined using logical `AND` operators. (e.g., `source=myApp; status=active`)

There is a helping dialog available to the right of the message-header input field.

[[user-interface-execution-results]]
=== Viewing Execution Results

The results of each scenario execution provide a comprehensive overview, including the outcome (such as Passed, Failed, or Errored), execution duration, and the parameters and data utilized during the execution.
You can even see full stacktraces to debug your scenario failures.
To access the detailed results of a specific execution, simply select the desired entry from the list.

image:scenario-execution-details.png[Scenario Execution Details, title="Detailed view of a scenario execution, including request/response data and any logged messages or errors"]

*Detailed Execution Insights*

Upon opening an execution entry, you will be presented with a detailed account of the scenario's activity, including:

* Error Details: In cases of failure, detailed error information, including stack traces, is provided to aid in diagnosing and resolving issues.
* Request and Response Messages: The exact data sent and received, allowing for a detailed inspection of the scenario's external interactions.
* Actions: All actions that were recorded during execution, provides additional information about the course of the scenario.

*Navigation and Analysis*

The user interface is designed to facilitate easy navigation through the execution history.
Use available tools such as filters to narrow down the list by status, date range, or specific keywords.
Each execution entry is designed to offer a quick summary, with more in-depth data just a click away for those requiring further analysis.

*Troubleshooting with Execution Details*

The detailed view of scenario executions is an invaluable tool for troubleshooting.
By examining the requests and responses, users can identify discrepancies or unexpected behavior.
Furthermore, the detailed logs and error messages serve as a direct insight into the scenario's runtime, aiding in rapid diagnosis and resolution of any issues encountered.

Leveraging the execution details effectively can significantly enhance the efficiency of testing cycles and contribute to a more robust and reliable testing process within the Citrus framework.

[[user-interface-entities]]
== Exploring Database Entities

For instances when you require more detailed information or are unable to locate specific data within the simulator's UI, the "Entities" drop-down menu offers a solution.
Located at the top of the user interface, this menu provides direct access to all database entities used by the simulator, allowing for an in-depth review of the underlying data.

[[user-interface-entities-access]]
=== Accessing Database Entities

To explore the database entities:

1. Navigate to the top menu of the simulator's user interface.
2. Locate and click on the "Entities" drop-down menu.
3. Select the specific entity you wish to review from the list that appears.

Each selection provides a detailed view of the chosen entity, including all relevant records and their attributes.
This feature is particularly useful for advanced users who need to analyze the simulator's data storage, audit logs, or troubleshoot specific issues related to the data.
