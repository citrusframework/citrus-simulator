[[user-interface]]
= User interface

The simulator application is started as a Spring boot web application. If you open your browser and point to the running simulator instance at `http://localhost:8080`
you will see the default welcome page.

The default ui is straight forward and limited to viewing Json response data returned by the simulator REST API. Fortunately there is also a more comfortable user interface based
on Angular2 available. Users can then access an administrative web user interface in order to review the simulator status and list all executed scenarios and their outcome.

The simulator Angular2 user interface comes as dependency that is added to the simulator project. In Maven we simply add the following dependency:

[source, xml]
----
<!-- Simulator web ui -->
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.consol.citrus</groupId>
  <artifactId>citrus-simulator-ui</artifactId>
  <version>${citrus.simulator.version}</version>
</dependency>
----

Now you can start the simulator and open your browser pointing to the simulator UI at `http://localhost:8080`. You will see the extended
web application user interface that gives you information about the simulator.

[[ui-dashboard]]
== Dashboard

The simulator dashboard gives you a quick overview of the numbers and facts on your simulator project.

[[ui-scenarios]]
== Scenarios

The user interface lists all available scenarios. These are scenarios that are available for automatic mapping when incoming requests are handled.

In case you open one of the listed scenarios you get a detailed information page of that specific scenario.

[[ui-activity]]
== Activities

Each time a scenario instance is started the user interface will display that scenario as running activity.

You can view the details of that scenario activity when opening a specific activity entry.

[ui-messages]
== Messages

When scenarios get executed they usually exchange several messages in request and response communication. These messages are also stored in the simulator so you
can review all exchanged messages on a scenario in the user interface.

Open a specific message entry and you will see the details such as header information and message payload details.
