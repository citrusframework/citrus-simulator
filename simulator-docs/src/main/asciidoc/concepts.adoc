The Citrus simulator's primary focus is to provide a simple means to simulate one or more endpoints (HTTP, JMS, SMTP, etc). Once the simulator is up and running it waits for an incoming request (JSON, SOAP, XML, etc) to arrive on any of its configured endpoints and reacts accordingly. The simulator examines the incoming request and determines which link:#scenarios[simulator scenario] should be executed for handling the request. Typically the selected scenario creates a response message to send back to the calling client.

A link:#scenario-mapper[scenario mapper] is used to help the simulator determine the correct scenario to be executed. Different scenario mappers are supported that use the request header data or payload data to determine the appropriate scenario to run.

A link:#scenarios[simulator scenario] is capable of handling one or more request messages. When executed it receives the request and can return an appropriate response message to the calling client.
By defining multiple simulator scenarios the citrus simulator is able to respond to different requests accordingly.

A simulator scenario is composed of one or more actions. For the most trivial scenarios there is generally an action for receiving a request and an action for sending a response.
Because the Citrus simulator has access to the underlying Citrus framework functionality you can access a wide range of actions that are available within the Citrus framework and use these when configuring a scenario.

To keep an eye on what the simulator is doing, what requests were received or sent or what scenarios were executed a link:#user-interface[user interface] is provided. In addition to seeing what is going on it is also possible to trigger scenarios manually.

[[concept-simulator-application]]
== Simulator application

The simulator is a usual Spring boot application. This means we have a main class that loads the Spring boot application.

[source,java]
----
import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;

@SpringBootApplication
public class Simulator {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(Simulator.class, args);
    }
}
----

This class is the main entrance for all configuration and customization statements. As we have added the *citrus-simulator-starter* as dependency in our project
auto configuration is enabled for the simulator application. By default REST support is enabled with all configuration needed. You can enable/disable the message transport
support for different technologies via application properties.

.application.properties
[source,properties]
----
citrus.simulator.rest.enabled=true
citrus.simulator.jms.enabled=true
citrus.simulator.ws.enabled=true
citrus.simulator.ws.client.enabled=true
citrus.simulator.endpoint.enabled=true
----

When enabled the simulator auto configuration for this specific message transport is activated and all required beans and configuration is loaded at startup.

.Simulator support
[horizontal]
citrus.simulator.rest.enabled:: Enables link:#rest-support[Http REST support]
citrus.simulator.ws.enabled:: Enables link:#ws-support[SOAP web services support]
citrus.simulator.ws.client.enabled:: Enables link:#ws-support[SOAP web services support]
citrus.simulator.jms.enabled:: Enables link:#jms-support[JMS support]
citrus.simulator.endpoint.enabled:: Enables generic link:#endpoint-component-support[endpoint component support]

You can also combine message transports on the simulator application although this feature is of experimental nature up to now.

[[concept-simulator-properties]]
== Simulator properties

The simulator is capable of loading configuration from system properties, environment variables and property files. First of all the default Spring boot properties configuration mechanism
is supported. Following from that you can add properties to the `application.properties` file in your project resources in order to adjust simulator behavior.

[source,properties]
----
citrus.simulator.rest.enabled=true
citrus.simulator.defaultTimeout=10000
citrus.simulator.templatePath=com/company/simulator/templates
----

The available simulator properties are grouped in following configuration classes:

[horizontal]
org.citrusframework.simulator.config.SimulatorConfigurationProperties:: prefix=*citrus.simulator*
org.citrusframework.simulator.http.SimulatorRestConfigurationProperties:: prefix=*citrus.simulator.rest*
org.citrusframework.simulator.ws.SimulatorWebServiceConfigurationProperties:: prefix=*citrus.simulator.ws*
org.citrusframework.simulator.ws.SimulatorWebServiceClientConfigurationProperties:: prefix=*citrus.simulator.ws.client*
org.citrusframework.simulator.jms.SimulatorJmsConfigurationProperties:: prefix=*citrus.simulator.jms*

There are several properties that you can use in order to customize the simulator behavior. These
properties are:

.Spring boot application properties
[horizontal]
citrus.simulator.templatePath:: Default path to message payload template files.
citrus.simulator.defaultScenario:: Default scenario name.
citrus.simulator.defaultTimeout:: Timeout when waiting for inbound messages.
citrus.simulator.templateValidation:: Enable/disable schema validation.
citrus.simulator.exceptionDelay:: Default delay in milliseconds to wait after uncategorized exceptions.
citrus.simulator.executor.threads:: The number of threads available for parallel scenario execution.
citrus.simulator.rest.urlMapping:: Handler adapter url mapping for inbound requests
citrus.simulator.ws.servletMapping:: Message dispatcher servlet mapping for inbound SOAP requests
citrus.simulator.jms.inboundDestination:: JMS destination name to consume inbound messages from
citrus.simulator.jms.replyDestination:: JMS destination name to publish reply messages to

Please refer to the respective configuration property classes to see what property settings are supported.

[[concept-simulator-system-properties]]
=== System properties

In addition to that default Spring boot property replacement the simulator also supports system property and environment variables. The properties are:

.System property names
[horizontal]
citrus.simulator.configuration.class:: Java configuration class that is automatically loaded. (default is org.citrusframework.simulator.SimulatorConfig)
citrus.simulator.template.path:: Default path to message payload template files.
citrus.simulator.default.scenario:: Default scenario name.
citrus.simulator.default.timeout:: Timeout when waiting for inbound messages.
citrus.simulator.template.validation:: Enable/disable schema validation.
citrus.simulator.exception.delay:: Default delay in milliseconds to wait after uncategorized exceptions.
citrus.simulator.executor.threads:: The number of threads available for parallel scenario execution.
citrus.simulator.rest.url.mapping:: Handler adapter url mapping for inbound requests
citrus.simulator.ws.servlet.mapping:: Message dispatcher servlet mapping for inbound SOAP requests
citrus.simulator.jms.inbound.destination:: JMS destination name to consume inbound messages from
citrus.simulator.jms.reply.destination:: JMS destination name to publish outbound messages to

You can set these properties as system properties when starting the Spring boot web application or you can add the properties to the default
Spring Boot application properties file *application.properties* that is located as resource file in your project.

The simulator will automatically load these properties during startup and honor this configuration.

[[concept-simulator-environment-variables]]
=== Environment variables

Same settings that are editable via system properties are also accessible via environment variables. This is extremely helpful when running the simulator in a containerized
infrastructure such as Docker or Kubernetes.

.Environment settings
[horizontal]
CITRUS_SIMULATOR_CONFIGURATION_CLASS:: Java configuration class that is automatically loaded. (default is org.citrusframework.simulator.SimulatorConfig)
CITRUS_SIMULATOR_TEMPLATE_PATH:: Default path to message payload template files.
CITRUS_SIMULATOR_DEFAULT_SCENARIO:: Default scenario name.
CITRUS_SIMULATOR_DEFAULT_TIMEOUT:: Timeout when waiting for inbound messages.
CITRUS_SIMULATOR_TEMPLATE_VALIDATION:: Enable/disable schema validation.
CITRUS_SIMULATOR_EXCEPTION_DELAY:: Default delay in milliseconds to wait after uncategorized exceptions.
CITRUS_SIMULATOR_EXECUTOR_THREADS:: The number of threads available for parallel scenario execution.
CITRUS_SIMULATOR_REST_URL_MAPPING:: Handler adapter url mapping for inbound requests
CITRUS_SIMULATOR_WS_SERVLET_MAPPING:: Message dispatcher servlet mapping for inbound SOAP requests
CITRUS_SIMULATOR_JMS_INBOUND_DESTINATION:: JMS destination name to consume inbound messages from
CITRUS_SIMULATOR_JMS_REPLY_DESTINATION:: JMS destination name to publish outbound messages to

In case these environment variables are present on your local system the simulator will automatically load these settings during startup and honor the configuration.

[[concept-simulator-spring-configuration]]
== Spring bean configuration

Citrus works with the Spring framework and the simulator is a Spring boot application. Therefore the configuration is done by adding and overwriting Spring beans in
the application context. The simulator automatically loads Spring beans defined in following locations:

* *META-INF/citrus-simulator.xml* Xml Spring bean configuration file.
* *org.citrusframework.simulator.SimulatorConfig* Java configuration class. You can customize this class by defining the property *citrus.simulator.configuration.class*

All beans defined in there get automatically loaded to the simulator Spring application context.
