          We are excited to announce that the Simulator UI has been comprehensively updated in our latest 3.0.0 release.
          This marks a significant advancement for our development team.
          The updated UI adheres to current best practices, utilizes up-to-date dependencies, and features well-structured, formatted, and thoroughly tested code.
          This transformation not only brings the project back to a state of sustainable maintainability but also allows us to roll out updates and new releases more swiftly.

          However, for our valued users, these changes may present a different experience from the previous UI.
          The interface now sports a fresh look, and you might notice alterations in behavior.
          Additionally, some functionalities might differ from those in earlier versions, impacting the UI's interaction.
