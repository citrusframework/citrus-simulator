= Build Tool "citrus"

This `citrus` script can be found in `$PROJECT_DIR/tools/cli` and helps with development related tasks such as performing an
automated release. It requires bash and can be used on any Unix or macOS.

To have this script handy all the time it is recommended to either put this `cli/` directory into the path or add a
symlink from `citrus` into a directory which is already on your execution path.

[source,bash]
----
# Navigate to the Citrus project directory
cd $PROJECT_DIR

# Set path to include this project's tools directory
$ export PATH=${PATH}:$(pwd)/tools/cli

# Alternatively, set a symbolic link to the "citrus" script
$ ln -s $(pwd)/tools/cli/citrus /usr/local/bin
----

The script can be used for various tasks which are selected by a so-called command which is the first argument to the script.

Just type `citrus -h` to get an overview of the commands available:

[source,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
.Usage message
----
Usage: citrus <command> [... options ...]

with the following commands

   help             Display this help message
   release          Perform a release

"help" is the default command if no command is specified.
----

There are a handful of global options which can be used:

[cols="3,1,15"]
|===
| `--help`
| `-h`
| Print usage information. If a command is given print out commands specific options

| `--man`
|
| Open HTML documentation on citrusframework.org

| `--verbose`
|
| Set verbose mode, which is useful mostly only for debugging the script itself.
|===

[[build-tool-commands]]
.Commands
All other options are specific to each command.
You get a list of those options with `citrus <cmd> -h`.
These options are described in detail in the next sections.

The following commands are available:

[cols="3,15",options="header"]
|===
| Command
| Description

| <<build-tool-release,**release**>>
| Perform a release with given version and automated publishing of Maven artifacts
|===

If no command is given, `help` is the default.
Remember a command must be the first argument, but there are additional possibilities to specify commands:

* You can use the form `--command_name` anywhere as an option, too. E.g. using  `--release` is the same as specifying "release" as the first argument.

To add a new command, just drop a script file into `$PROJECT_DIR/tools/cli/commands` directory with following structure:

[source,bash]
----
#!/bin/bash

yourscriptname::description() {
    echo "Describe the command"
}

yourscriptname::usage() {
    cat <<EOT
    Describe the usage of the command
EOT
}

yourscriptname::run() {
    Do your stuff
}
----

The following sections describe the commands in more detail.

[[build-tool-release]]
== Release

Use `citrus release` for performing an automated release.
A release consists of:

* Bump versions to given release version in pom.xml and any other resources
* Build and stage Maven artifacts
* Git release commit and tag
* Bump versions to given next snapshot version
* Release Maven artifacts to Maven central and push changes to github repository

This chapter describes how you can efficiently perform a release and how to troubleshoot if something goes wrong.

[[build-tool-release-usage]]
=== Usage

This command performs a release but does *no* automated rollback when something fails.
Please refer to the <<build-tool-release-troubleshooting,*troubleshooting*>> section for more details and what needs
to be cleaned up in case of a failure.

----
Perform a release

Usage: citrus release [... options ...]

Options for release:
-n  --dry-run                 Dry run, which performs the whole build but does no tagging, artifact
                              upload or pushing Docker images
    --release-version <ver>   Version to release (e.g. "1.2.1"). One version arg is mandatory
    --next-version <ver>      Version to use after the release. Usually the next snapshot version.
    --local-release           Release to local repository
    --snapshot-release        Snapshot release which can be created on a daily basis.
                              A timestamped version will be created automatically
                              and no Maven artifacts are pushed to maven central.
    --settings <file>         Path to a custom settings.xml to use for the release.
                              This file must contain all the credentials to be used for Sonatype.
                              By default ~/.m2/settings.xml is used.
    --local-maven-repo <dir>  Local dir for holding the local Maven repo cache. For a clean build
                              just give the option without specifying any directory, then a new
                              temporary directory will be used (and removed after the release)
                              By default ~/.m2/repository is used.
    --no-git-push             Don't push the release tag (and symbolic major.minor tag) at the end
    --git-remote              Name of the git remote to push to. If not given, its trying to be pushed
                              to the git remote to which the currently checked out branch is attached to.
                              Works only when on a branch, not when checked out directly.
    --log <log-file>          Write full log to <log-file>, only print progress to screen
    --skip-tests              Do not run tests
    --no-strict-checksums     Do not insist on strict checksum policy for downloaded Maven artifacts
-q  --quiet                   Adds quiet option to Maven options - only show errors
    --man                     Open HTML documentation on citrusframework.org
----

A lot of output is produced during a release.
If you are only interested to see the major steps only, then you can use `--log` to redirect the output to a specific log file.
This log file will contain all output (and if you add `--verbose` you see even more output), but on the console you will
only see the current step that is actually performed.

.Example
An example run for a dry run for release version `1.0.0` on the current branch look like:

[source,bash,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
./tools/cli/citrus release             \ <1>
    --release-version 1.0.0            \ <2>
    --next-version 1.1-SNAPSHOT        \ <3>
    --local-maven-repo /tmp/clean-repo \ <4>
    --log /tmp/build.log               \ <5>
    --dry-run                            <6>
----
<1> Always run `citrus` from the repo and branch you want to release.
<2> The release version is mandatory and must be in the format `<major>.<minor>.<patch>`.
<3> The next version is mandatory and must be in the format `<major>.<minor>-SNAPSHOT`.
<4> Use a clean local Maven repository to avoid side effects (optional)
<5> Redirect the full output to `/tmp/build.log` but still print the main steps to the console.
<6> Make only a dry run, without pushing any artifacts out nor doing any commit/push of changed files.

[[build-tool-release-preparations]]
=== Preparations

To perform a release, certain preconditions need to be given.

First of all, you need to have access to the various systems to which release artifacts are uploaded:

* You have to have `gpg` installed and set up a gpg-agent for being able to sign Maven artifacts during deployment in a non-interactive mode.
* You need to have access to the "citrus" account on https://oss.sonatype.org/[oss.sonatype.org] for being able to publish Maven artifacts.
This credential needs to be added to either your `~/.m2/settings.xml` or you can use an settings file with the `--settings-xml` option.
The credential needs to be added to the server with the id `sonatype-nexus-staging`.

You have to perform the release from a locally checked out project repository, which can be either checkout from a branch like `1.0.x` for a
patch release or directly from `master`.
It is highly recommended to run the release directly from a freshly cloned directory:

[source,bash,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
# Go to a temporary directory
cd /tmp

# Clone repository afresh, but only use the last history entry (--depth=1)
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/citrusframework/citrus-simulator.git

# Jump into the directory
cd citrus-simulator

# Switch to the target branch if needed (or stay on master)
git fetch --depth 1 origin 1.0.x:1.0.x
git checkout 1.0.x

# Call the build tool script from the checked out clone
./tools/cli/citrus release --release-version 1.0.1 .....

# Push to origin after a successful release (this automatically done unless --no-git-push is given)
git push
# Push tag to origin (this automatically done unless --no-git-push is given)
git push origin "v1.0.1"

# Remove the temporary clone again
cd ..
rm -rf citrus-simulator
----

Please note that you should always call `citrus` out of the branch for which the release is for. You might need to `
adjust your local `$PATH settings accordingly.

[[build-tool-release-steps]]
=== Release steps

A release consist of several different steps, which can be grouped into two groups:

* *Build steps* are performed to build the release and create the artifacts.
Also during the build Maven artifacts are uploaded to the staging area for publishing to Maven central
* *Persist steps* are then used for releasing objects, pushing Docker images to Docker Hub, committing and tagging in Git (but only when the build steps have been performed successfully).

==== Build steps

* Check whether the current local Git clone is _clean_, i.e. you should not have any modified files.
The script will abort if this is the case.
* Update the versions of all `pom.xml` to the version given with `--release-version`.
If no `--release-version` is given, then the script aborts.
* Run an `mvn clean install` to verify that the build is not broken and all tests succeed. You can skip tests with `--skip-tests` though.
* Deploy all artifacts to a new staging repository on https://oss.sonatype.org/[oss.sonatype.org]. The staging repository on
this Sonatype Nexus is validated and closed.

If the option `--dry-run` (short: `-n`) is provided, the script drops the staging repository at Sonatype and stops. You can now examine the generated files before starting a real build.

By default the builds are using your local Maven repository from `~/.m2/repository`.

If you want to run the builds with a clean local Maven repository you can provide such a directory with `--local-maven-repo /tmp/my-clean-repo` which will be taken directly as Maven repo.
This new local cache should ensure that we have a completely fresh build without interference from previous builds store in the local Maven cache in the home directory.

If `--local-maven-repo` is provided but no directory path is given a new temporary directory is created and also _deleted_ after the release run.

==== Persist steps

* The staging repository on Sonatype is released.
It will take a bit, but the artifact should then be downloadable from https://search.maven.org/[Maven central] soon after.
* Update the versions of all `pom.xml` to the version given with `--next-version`. Usually the next snapshot version to use.
If no `--next-version` is given, then the script aborts.
* Commit all modified local files to the local Git repo.
* Create a Git tag for the release version (e.g. `git tag v1.0.0`).

Finally, the tags just created on the local Git repo is pushed to the remote repository.
You can omit this with the option `--no-git-push`.
If to so, the last step can also be performed manually afterwards with:

[source,bash,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
git push
git push origin "v1.0.1" <1>
----
<1> Tag name that was just created from the script.

=== Snapshot Release

With the option `--snapshot-release` a snapshot release can be created.
The tag/version is calculated automatically by picking up the `--release-version` (e.g. 1.0.1) and adding a daily timestamp (e.g. 1.0.1-20180419).
According to  https://semver.org/[Semantic Versioning 2.0] this is considered to be a version larger than 1.0.1 but https://semver.org/#spec-item-11[smaller] than 1.0.2.

In detail, a snapshot release differs from a normal release as it force pushes the snapshot tag on GitHub so that multiple releases per day are allowed.

.Example
[source,bash,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
citrus release \
     --snapshot-release                 \ <1>
     --release-version 1.0.1            \ <2>
     --next-version 1.1-SNAPSHOT        \ <3>
     --local-maven-repo /tmp/clean-repo   <4>
----
<1> Enable snapshot release with a version in the format $release-version-$timestamp
<2> The release version is mandatory and must be in the format `<major>.<minor>.<patch>`.
<3> The next version is mandatory and must be in the format `<major>.<minor>-SNAPSHOT`.
<4> Point to an empty repository to avoid side effects when building

[[build-tool-release-troubleshooting]]
=== Troubleshooting

When you run the `citrus release` command and it should happen to fail, you might have to perform some cleanup steps manually
as there is now automatic rollback.

However care has been taken to move all persistent changes to the end of the release flow, so if something breaks early,
you only need to clean up locally. If the process fails before the step _==== Releasing Sonatype staging repo_ you only need to:

* Reset your local git repo with `git reset --hard`
* Potentially remove the created staging repository on https://oss.sonatype.org/[oss.sonatype.org]

The release of the staging repository on https://oss.sonatype.org/[oss.sonatype.org] is the point of no return. Once this is done the artifacts
with that release version are publicly available on Maven central. If things go wrong after that step you will need to do the git steps by yourself.

* make sure the release versions in pom.xml are committed
* create a git release tag
* update all pom.xml versions to the next snapshot version
* commit and push to github
